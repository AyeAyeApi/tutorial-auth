Aye Aye Tutorial - Authentication Service
=========================================

This tutorial will step you through how to create an Authentication Service with Aye Aye Api. The tutorial is broken
into two parts. [Part 1][part-1] we will build simple registration and password checking end points. [Part 2][part-2]
we will build an OAuth Provider that will allow other applications to log in on behalf of users with reduced privileges.

Requirements
------------

To follow this demo, you will need:
- [PHP 5.5][php] or greater
- [Composer][composer]

Part 1 - Registration and Login
-------------------------------

(Work in progress)

Let's start by creating a new project. We're going to need the following packages:
- [Aye Aye Api][aye-aye-api] - The framework for the API
- [Doctrine ORM][doctrine-orm] - To provide a database abstraction layer
- [LuÃ­s Cobucci's JWT Library][jwt] - To provide an authentication token

We're also going to plan and test our work with Behat:
- [Aye Aye's Behat Feature Context][aye-aye-behat] - For behavioural driven development and testing

> Side Note: I also recommend the following tools. We won't go into them for the purpose of this tutorial, but examples
exist in the tutorial repository:
- [PHPUnit][phpunit] - For test driven development
- [Squizlabs PHPCS][phpcs] - Code sniffer for conforming to standards (we use PSR-1 and PSR-2)
- [PHPMD][phpmd] - Mess detection tool for telling us if our code is too complex 

That's a lot of tools! But don't worry, a lot of it is quality control and planning, and once that's set up we don't
need to worry so much about it.

### Step 1 - Setting up

Let's get started. We'll begin with just a blank project. From the command line, run:

```bash
composer init -n --name=[package name]
```

Swap `[package name]` with whatever you want to call your project. You can additionally add in a license and author 
here. For example, I used: 

```bash
composer init -n --name=ayeaye/auth --license=MIT --author="Daniel Mason <daniel@ayeayeapi.com>"
```

Next, in two separate steps we'll grab the packages we'll need for our service to run and the packages we'll use for
development:

```bash
composer require ayeaye/api doctrine/orm lcobucci/jwt
composer require --dev ayeaye/behat-feature-context
```

Next, lets configure our quality and testing utilities.

We're going to put our source code in a director called `src`, our tests in a directory called `tests` and our public 
files in a directory called `public`.
